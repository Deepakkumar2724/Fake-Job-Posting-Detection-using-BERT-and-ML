# 🧠 BERT Project: Contextual NLP Using Transformers

This project leverages the power of **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** to perform advanced Natural Language Processing tasks using pre-trained transformer models.

The notebook contains all the steps from data preprocessing to model inference, showcasing how BERT can be fine-tuned or used for embeddings in real-world text data.
